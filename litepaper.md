# CONTINENTAL WICK — LORE EDITION LITE PAPER
![logo](/assets/logo.png)

## Cinematic Introduction
In the shadows of the ledger, where order clashes with mutation and the mempool pulses like a living machine, the Continental Protocol stands guard. It is not a government. It is not a corporation. It is a structure — ancient in purpose, digital in form, and engineered to preserve balance.

The ledger has begun to distort. Characters manifest: some disciplined, others grotesque. These entities are archived as Collector Cards — digital protocol records anchored by the $WCK token.

## The Protocol Universe
The Continental Protocol stabilizes the unpredictable nature of ledger mutation. Operators uphold order; anomalies challenge it. The universe is built on a simple tension: **Order vs Chaos**.

---

## The Collector Card Archive
Cards are Protocol Records.  
Each one is a ledger-stamped snapshot of an operator, threat, anomaly, enforcer, or entity.  
Collectors are **Witnesses** — recognized but not controlling canon.
