## Project Summary

CONTINENTAL WICK is the **official token and collector system of the CONTINENTAL protocol** — a universe of protocol enforcers, vault agents, and signal operators running on $XRP rails.

$WCK is the spine of a structured ecosystem:

- The **token layer** for access, alignment, and protocol actions. 
- A **Collector Card NFT series** that turns protocol roles into character-driven digital collectibles.

The endgame is simple — build a **living collector series** on XRPL: evolving characters, escalating threats, and expanding sets that feel like a true card universe, not just another loose NFT drop. 

**The Utility That Memes.**

## Role of $WCK

$WCK operates as the native asset of the CONTINENTAL protocol:

- **Access and Alignment** 
 - Priority access to future CONTINENTAL drops and expansions. 
 - Community alignment layer for ecosystem direction at the discretion of the team. 

- **Collector and Protocol Utility** 
 - Used as a key reference asset for future card drops, protocol events, and gated experiences. 
 - Eligible to be integrated into collector mechanics such as raffles, draws, or snapshot-based rewards where legally permissible. 

- **Ecosystem Sync** 
 - Ties the core narrative together across **NFT series, physical product integrations, and protocol-grade tools** built on XRPL.

## CONTINENTAL WICK Collector Cards (NFTs)

$WCK powers a **series-based Collector Card universe** on XRPL. Each card is an NFT representing a protocol role inside the CONTINENTAL world.

### Core Structure

- **Network:** XRPL 
- **Standard:** XRPL NFT (NFToken) 
- **Format:** Character-based Collector Cards 
- **Series / Sets:** 
 - Built in **waves and series**, designed to feel like a true collector line. 
 - Base characters, variants, threat types, and protocol ranks.

Card #001 — **CONTINENTAL WICK** — anchors the entire story as the first ultra-rare protocol card. Subsequent cards expand the world: vault security, armory specialists, surveillance nodes, internal operators, and external threats.

### Collector Focus

The roadmap centers on turning CONTINENTAL WICK into a **recognizable collector franchise on XRPL**:

- Ongoing **series and expansions** of character cards. 
- Structured rarity and continuity across sets. 
- Visual and narrative cohesion that makes collecting the series as important as holding the token.

### Utility of the Cards

Collector Cards are designed to function as:

- **Lore Anchors** 
 - Each card defines a role, function, and place inside the protocol. 

- **Collector Assets** 
 - Rarity, editions, and series give collectors clear goals and targets. 

- **Access Keys** 
 - Priority access or enhanced weighting for future CONTINENTAL releases. 
 - Potential eligibility for physical tie-ins, digital airdrops, or protocol events where allowed. 

All specific mechanics, benefits, or redemptions are defined and updated on [continentalwick.com](https://continentalwick.com) and in official posts as the ecosystem evolves.

## Technology Stack

CONTINENTAL WICK is built on the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)** to leverage:

- **Speed** — near-instant settlement and confirmations. 
- **Cost Control** — low, predictable transaction fees. 
- **Deterministic Execution** — no gas auctions or mempool warfare. 
- **Native DEX and NFT Support** — built-in order books, AMMs, and NFT primitives. 

This stack keeps execution clean, transparent, and efficient for both the **$WCK token** and the **Collector Card series**.

## Roadmap Snapshot

The roadmap is built around **expanding the Collector Card universe** and solidifying CONTINENTAL WICK as a long-term collector brand on XRPL.

1. **Series 1 Completion and Expansion** 
 - Full deployment of Series 1 cards on XRPL. 
 - Clear rarity table and metadata for collectors. 

2. **Series-Based Collector Growth** 
 - Additional series and waves featuring new protocol roles, variants, and threats. 
 - Consistent art direction and lore so the collection feels like a continuous line, not fragmented drops. 

3. **Collector Mechanics and Experiences** 
 - Snapshot-based recognition, themed events, and collector-focused activations where permitted. 
 - Deepening the connection between long-term collectors and the direction of the protocol universe. 

4. **Physical / Digital Tie-Ins** 
 - Exploration of physical product integrations and cross-medium collectibles that mirror or complement the on-ledger card universe. 

Sequence and details may adjust with market conditions, regulatory guidance, security posture, and technical realities — but the north star remains the same: **grow CONTINENTAL WICK as a serious collector series on XRPL.**
